Security Policy
===============

This file describes how security issues are reported and handled, and what the
expectations are for security issues reported to this project.


What is a Security Bug?
-----------------------

Not every bug is a security bug.

Certain bugs that might be considered security bugs in a program, such as bugs
that lead to a Denial of Service, are *not* considered security bugs simply
because this project *does not provide a service*.  Some might argue that, "my
server uses this library and the bug in this library causes a denial of service
for my server", however it is the responsibility of the *server* to protect
against DoS attacks, not a subordinate library, because only the server knows
what is an appropriate use of memory, CPU, time, and other resources.

Similarly, bugs caused by incorrect API usage such as passing `NULL` pointers
where such pointers are not allowed, passing the wrong kinds of pointers or
objects to an API, or using a private API are not security bugs because they
are not caused by an attacker but by the developer.

Finally, bugs that only exist in unreleased (non-production) or inactive code
are not security bugs because they do not affect ordinary users.  See the
[Supported Versions](#supported-versions) section below for more information
about what versions of the project are covered by this security policy.

If the bug you've found falls into one of these three categories, please report
the bug as an the ordinary project issue at
<https://github.com/michaelrsweet/htmlcss/issues>.


Reporting a Security Bug
------------------------

For the purposes of this project, a security bug is a software defect that
allows a *local or remote user* to gain unauthorized access or privileges on the
host computer.  Such defects should be reported to the project security advisory
page at <https://github.com/michaelrsweet/htmlcss/security/advisories>.


Responsible Disclosure
----------------------

With *responsible disclosure*, a security issue (and its fix) is disclosed only
after a mutually-agreed period of time (the "embargo date").  The issue and fix
are shared amongst and reviewed by the key stakeholders (Linux distributions,
OS vendors, etc.) and the CERT/CC.  Fixes are released to the public on the
agreed-upon date.

> Responsible disclosure applies only to production releases.  A security
> vulnerability that only affects unreleased code can be fixed immediately
> without coordination.  Vendors *should not* package and release unstable
> snapshots, beta releases, or release candidates of this software.


Supported Versions
------------------

All production releases of this software are subject to this security policy.  A
production release is tagged and given a semantic version number of the form:

    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

where "MAJOR" is an integer starting at 1 and "MINOR" and "PATCH" are integers
starting at 0.  A feature release has a "PATCH" value of 0, for example:

    1.0.0
    1.1.0
    2.0.0

Beta releases and release candidates are *not* production releases and use
semantic version numbers of the form:

    MAJOR.MINORbNUMBER
    MAJOR.MINORrcNUMBER

where "MAJOR" and "MINOR" identify the new feature release version number and
"NUMBER" identifies a beta or release candidate number starting at 1, for
example:

    1.0b1
    1.0b2
    1.0rc1
